## Overview of the statistical analysis
New York City is known for being a very populated city (27,000 people per square mile), in consecuence, The Big Apple tops the list of most congested cities in the United States, with 102 lost hours in traffic in 2021. On a worldwide scale, New York City places fifth among the most congested cities. In order to avoid this traffic and also enjoy the view of the city, citizens of New York and outsiders tend to walk and ride a bike to get to their destinations, tour, etc.

All that being said, a privately run public bike sharing system serving part of New York City was established, "Citi Bike". Now, it is the largest bicycle sharing program in the United States. The system opened on May 27, 2013, with 330 stations and 6,000 bikes. This system has allowed this company to position itself as a top and important private company for the Big Apple. The idea of this module is to analyse the circumstances to propose a similar bike sharing system that can provide their services to a new city called Des Moines, capital of Iowa.

The layout of Des Moines is far more rural than New York city, each with a population per square mile of 2,515.6 and 27,012.5 respectively (ref 1). With a smaller population density Des Moines city will be able to easily implement bike lines for increased bike safety, along with bike paths through green space. These small infrastructure upgrades will increase the number of riders, as biking becomes less risk averse throughout the downtown city area, and even Greater Des Moines are, all this will be visualized using Tableau to visualize the data in a very neat way.

## Results
For this analysis of the bike sharing data, several points to visualize were proposed in order to create a high-level analysis. The results were the following:
