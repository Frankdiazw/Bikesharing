## Overview of the statistical analysis
New York City is known for being a very populated city (27,000 people per square mile), in consecuence, The Big Apple tops the list of most congested cities in the United States, with 102 lost hours in traffic in 2021. On a worldwide scale, New York City places fifth among the most congested cities. In order to avoid this traffic and also enjoy the view of the city, citizens of New York and outsiders tend to walk and ride a bike to get to their destinations, tour, etc.

All that being said, a privately run public bike sharing system serving part of New York City was established, "Citi Bike". Now, it is the largest bicycle sharing program in the United States. The system opened on May 27, 2013, with 330 stations and 6,000 bikes. This system has allowed this company to position itself as a top and important private company for the Big Apple. The idea of this module is to analyse the circumstances to propose a similar bike sharing system that can provide their services to a new city called Des Moines, capital of Iowa.

The layout of Des Moines is far more rural than New York city, each with a population per square mile of 2,515.6 and 27,012.5 respectively (ref 1). With a smaller population density Des Moines city will be able to easily implement bike lines for increased bike safety, along with bike paths through green space. These small infrastructure upgrades will increase the number of riders, as biking becomes less risk averse throughout the downtown city area, and even Greater Des Moines are, all this will be visualized using Tableau to visualize the data in a very neat way.

## Results
For this analysis of the bike sharing data, several points to visualize were proposed in order to create a high-level analysis. The results were the following:

### **Number of Trips**

### **Peak Riding Hours in August**

### **Checkout Times**
### **Trips by Weekday for Each Hour**
### **User Trips by Gender by Weekday**

## Summary
From this analysis we can understand that although New York and Des Moines are starkly different in size in population, there are some universal factors that can be implemented in both places:

- Bike service locations tend to be more active and popular in places where keeping a car is not financially economical
- Affordability and availability plays a key factor in the concentration of bike ride starting points
- Bikes are also used more actively in areas where the distances are smaller and and can be traversed by bike
- Subscribers and Males tend to make a larger share of users as compared to customers and other genders
- Early mornings (1 AM to 5 AM) are less busy and can be used to service or repair the bikes
- The most popular rides were those of a shorter duration from a range of 5 to 11 minutes for all genders
- Rush Hours and Weekends are more active time periods for rides
- 8 AM, 5 PM and 6 PM were the most active hours in the data throughout the week
- These trends followed similarly for all genders
- Younger users generally travelled larger distances/ had longer trip durations
- The most popular ride locations were in the heart of the city
